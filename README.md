https://fordforums.com.au/vbportal/viewcategory.php?moduleid=82 (registration needed before you can see the page)

The forum is great and informative regarding to Ford Australia made vehicles, especially the Working Shop Manuals are really helpful for those who DIY their cars. However the forum embeds the scanned manual into web pages and does not allow you to download by right-click. So this script would download these scaned pages and merge them into a single PDF file in your local machine, for off-line reading and printing. 

All the copyrights of scanned images belong to fordforums.com.au, and any file generated by this script can not be used in any commercial activities.

How to use
----------
    python ff-wsm-imgsav.py
Type in your username and password.

Then the script would open and list all vehicle options currently available in the forum.

You can choose the vehicle you're after by type in the index number.

Then the script would list all sections in the working shop manual avaiable for this vehicle.

Again, choose the index number for the section you want to check.

Then the script will tell you how many pages it has and automatically starts downloading.

All the images downloaded will be merged into a pdf file named with the section number.
